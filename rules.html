      You and the computer will both start off with random stats. You have the
      choice to attack or defend. If you defend and the computer's attack
      doesn't do damage to you, then you regain some fatigue which is your
      health. If both you and the computer defend you will both gain some
      fatigue. One the computer's fatigue is 0 or below, you can use your
      finishing move. You can also use it when your fatigue is more than double
      the computer's. However, the same rules apply to the computer. A finishing
      move, is a one hit KO move. It will 100% land and whoever delivers it will
      win the game!
